December 2, 2025 ERROR CHECK

Overall:
1. Goal: 1 file per year for germinants, like seed sorted
     A. Headers: year stand trapno spp germintrap (spp = 4 letter code)
     B. If zero OR data not collected (assume zero), no entry
     C. If not collected, assume zero (no entry) - see point 2
2. Indicate for which stands / traps / years the germinants in trap census not done (in readme). DONE 
3. Question - what to do about cones on trap lid? Notes were taken about this.
4. Question - notes about traps being broken even if sample collected, which could affect results. Not consistently collected. Should this be noted?
