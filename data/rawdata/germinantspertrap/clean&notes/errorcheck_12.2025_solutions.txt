December 2, 2025 ERROR CHECK

Overall:
1. Goal: 1 file per year for germinants, like seed sorted
     A. Headers: year stand trapno spp germintrap (spp = 4 letter code)
     B. If zero OR data not collected (assume zero), no entry
     C. If not collected, assume zero (no entry) - see point 2
2. Indicate for which stands / traps / years the germinants in trap census not done. 
3. Question - what to do about cones on trap lid? Notes were taken about this.
4. Question - notes about traps being broken even if sample collected, which could affect results. Not consistently collected. Should this be noted?

10. 2018 data
- rename columns (Year = year, Stand = stand, Trapno = trapno, Species = spp, Germinants = germintrap)
- remove columns Date, Field Notes and Data Entry Notes
- remove rows with NA for species (no germinants in trap)
- remove rows with blank for Species and Germinants
- rename TO12, TO13, TO14, TO15, TO16 to TO11
- PP17 trap 6 no germinants recorded - add to readme DONE
- not clear why there is an NA entry for years, NA for AB08 germs and traps, and for an empty stand? remove bottom few rows of .csv file. DONE

11. 2019 data
- rename columns (Year = year, Stand = stand, Trapno = trapno, Species = spp, Germinants = germintrap)
- remove columns Date, Field Notes and Data Entry Notes
- no entry for TB13 - check data entry sheet
- The entry '-' for Species and Germinants was used when there was a note about the seed trap, but no germinants to note. Remove all these rows.
- The entry NA for Species was used when there was a note about the seed trap, but no germinants to note. Remove all these rows. 
- There was an unknown germinant, remove this row
- not clear why there is an NA entry for years and a blank entry for stand...? remove bottom few rows of .csv file. DONE

11. 2020 data
- rename columns (Year = year, Stand = stand, Trapno = trapno, Species = spp, Germinants = germintrap)
- remove columns Date, Field Notes and Data Entry Notes
- remove rows with NA for species (no germinants in trap)
- check Stand inventory file for AB08 trap 4, TO04 trap 2 - should be NAs (not collected). DONE - indeed missing, but so was AM16 trap 5 (not in germinants file). 
- not clear why there is an NA entry in years column, and an NA entry for trapno for AB08 (file doesn't look incorrect), and a few more. Remove bottom few rows of .csv file. DONE

12. 2021 data
- rename columns (Year = year, Stand = stand, Trapno = trapno, Species = spp, Germinants = germintrap)
- remove columns Date, Field Notes and Data Entry Notes
- remove rows with none for species (no germinants in trap), also a row with n/a (also has none)
- not clear why there is an NA entry in years column, and an NA entry for trapno for AB08 (file doesn't look incorrect), and a few more. Remove bottom few rows of .csv file. DONE

13. 2022 data
- rename columns (Year = year, Stand = stand, Trapno = trapno, Species = spp, Germinants = germintrap)
- remove columns Date, Field Notes and Data Entry Notes
- remove rows with no entry (blank) in Species column and a zero in Germinant column (indicates trap was surveyed but no germinants).
- remove rows with no entry (blank) in Species column and N/A in Germinant column (indicates trap was destroyed and could not be collected).
- check Stand inventory file for AO03 trap 9 and 13, was not collected. 
- replace Ab. sp. in AE10 with ABAM
- remove AB. SP in PARA (could be either ABLA or ABAM, both were spotted)
- not clear why there is an NA entry in years column, and an NA entry for trapno for AB08 (file doesn't look incorrect), and a few more. Remove bottom few rows of .csv file.
