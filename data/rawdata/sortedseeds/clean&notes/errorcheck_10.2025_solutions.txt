Things to do / check

OVERALL 
- 2009-2019 have different headers than 2020-2024. In writing files over, I will change the following 2009 - 2019 headers:
	Year to year (add this column if needed)
	Stand to stand
	Trapno to trapno
	Species to spp
	Whole_seeds to loose_sds_filled
	Unfilled_seeds to loose_sds_unfilled
	Cones to cones
	WholeSeeds_Cones to cones_sds_filled
	UnfilledSeeds_Cones to cones_sds_unfilled
	SeedsInCones to cones_sds_all
- before reading out, I will remove the country column from the 2020-2024 files

- 2009-2019 have the 4 letter codes while the 2020-2024 have full species names. Change to 2020 - 2024 species names to 4 letter codes. CHECK WITH CAMILLE ON THIS.

NOTES to add to read me
- note seeds in cones only counted, not sorted to filled and unfilled 2009 - 2012

YEAR SPECIFIC
1. 2009 data. No obvious issues. 
A. Create a 2009 trap inventory data that indicates no missing traps. DONE
B. Write the data over to the clean&notes folder. DONE

2. 2010 data. Check MISSING in Species. SOLUTION - This is for trap 3, PP17 (missing for that year), according to notes. 
A. Add this information to trap inventory csv file - DONE.
B. Remove that row from the 2010 raw data.
C. Write the data over to the clean&notes folder. DONE 

3. 2011 data. 
A. Check NOSEEDS in Species, 2011 full data. SOLUTION - this is for trap 1, SPRY. The bag exists and was sorted, according to notes. Remove the NOSEEDS row, as we will replace 0's with NAs based on the stand trap inventory (which will mean SPRY 1 is included with zeros).
B. Fall data. seems like it has already been summed? SOLUTION - remove fall data from github to avoid conclusion DONE BUT NEEDS CHECK
D. No traps missing. Create a 2011 inventory file to indicate this. DONE
E.  Write the data over to the clean&notes folder. 

4. 2012 data. No obvious issues. 
A. Create a 2012 trap inventory data that indicates no missing traps. DONE
B.  Write the data over to the clean&notes folder. DONE

5. 2013 data. 
A. Check MYST in Species. SOLUTION - likely seeds that could not be identified (2 in ABO8 trap 3, 13 in AM16 trap 6, 7 and 12 in TO04 trap 3, ). remove that row from the 2010 raw data when moving to cleaned data, check in WA. DONE
B. Check NOSEEDS in Species. This is for trap 2, SPRY. Probably this bag was collected and sorted but there were no seeds (true zeroes). Check the field notes, if correct, remove the NOSEEDS row, as we will replace 0's with NAs based on the stand trap inventory (which will mean SPRY 1 is included with zeros). DONE BUT NEEDS CHECK
C. No traps missing. Create a 2013 inventory file to indiciate this. DONE
D. Write the data over to the clean&notes folder. DONE


6. 2014 data. 
A. Check MYST in Species. SOLUTION - likely seeds that could not be identified (1 in AGO5 trap 4, 1 in AV02 trap 1, 12 in AV02 trap 2, 4 in PARA trap 4, 2 in TOO4 trap 3, 1 in TO04 trap 4). SOLUTION - remove.
B. No traps missing. Create a 2014 inventory file to indiciate this. DONE
C. Write the data over to the clean&notes folder. DONE


7. 2015 data. 
A. No obvious issues. Create a 2015 trap inventory data that indicates no missing traps. DONE
B. Write the data over to the clean&notes folder. DONE


8. 2016 data.
A. Check MISSING in species. EXPLANATION - AGO5 trap 4 AND PARA trap 2, these traps were not collected (tree fell down on it). NA (not zeros). Remove this line, and add this information to the stand inventory trap file. TAO1 trap 1 - collected but the bag was lost and not sorted. This is also an NA, not zero. SOLUTION - add these three traps to the 2016 stand trap inventory file when creating it. DONE
B. Remove these rows from the file. DONE
C. Check NA in trapno in TB13. SOLUTION - these seeds were sorted, but the trap and stand identity were lost (notes indicate it is likely from TB13, but all other traps have values). Remove from the data file, make a note to add for any yearly values. DONE BUT NEEDS CHECK.
D. Write the data over to the clean&notes folder. DONE

9. 2017 data.
A. Check MISSING in species. SOLUTION - this was TA01 trap 6, trap collected but lost. Add to seed trap inventory. DONE.
B. Remove MISSING rows from the file. DONE
C. Check NOSEEDS in species. SOLUTION - this is SPRY trap 2, this bag existed and was sorted, but no seeds. Remove the NOSEEDS row, as we will replace 0's with NAs based on the stand trap inventory (which will mean SPRY 1 is included with zeros). DONE
D. Change ACGL to ACCI DONE
E. Write the data over to the clean&notes folder. DONE

10. 2018 data. 
A. Check NA in species - SOLUTION - this is SPRY trap5. sorted but no seeds found. SOLUTION - remove row from data file, as the zeros will be added. DONE
B. No traps missing. Create a 2018 inventory file to indicate this. DONE
C. Write the data over to the clean&notes folder. DONE

12. 2020 data 
A. Check - AB08 trap 4 is missing? Not listed in Stand trap inventory. Solution - ask Camille about stand trap inventory file for this year, check field notes to see what happened (sorted but no seeds, or missing). For now, modified stand trap inventory file on github to include this (DONE BUT NEEDS CHECK).
B. Check AM16 trap 5 is missing? Not listed in Stand trap inventory. Solution - ask Camille about stand trap inventory, check field notes to see what happened (sorted but no seeds, or missing). For now, modified stand trap inventory file to include this (on github) (DONE BUT NEEDS CHECK).

E. Write data over to clean&notes folder DONE

13. 2021 data 
A. There are 2 A003's, one with 2 zeros (A003), and one with a O and a 0 (AO03). SOLUTION - these reflect duplicate entries of traps 5 and 6, so delete the incorrect one. Tell Camille.
B. There are duplicate entries of AO03, traps 1-4. SOLUTION - remove, tell Camille. DONE ON REMOVAL
C. There are 2 TO04's, one with 2 zeros, and one with a O and a 0. Solution - these reflect duplicate entries of TO04 trap 1, so remove the incorrect one. Tell Camille. REMOVED
D. There are duplicate entries of TO04, traps 2-6. SOLUTION - remove, tell Camille. REMOVED
E. Duplicate entries for all stands? REMOVED
F. There is an Abies amabilis   ?. This was in the duplicate entry of AO03, so should be removed once issue A. is resolved. CORRECT
G. There is an Abies sp. Solution - remove from data for now, ask Camille about this. DONE
